## Introduction

### Project Overview

---

This project is about creating an application to recommend to user wine and cheese according to the meal they want to eat.

The client is "Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence". <!-- Our contact point is ___, the --> <!-- TODO: add name & role. -->

---

### Project Definition

---

#### Vision

---

The vision behind this project is to help people chose better wine assortiment for their meal all day long, even when there is no department expert in the store. Allowing new commers and tourist to try and find by themselves new and local product.

---

#### Objectives

---

- **Helping client finding meal assortiment**: The application should allow user to find wine, or cheese without any human help.
- **Bringing discovery to client**: The application should permit client to discover new and local ingredients/wine. It would allow client to have a new experience with the French culture.
- **Ease of use**: The application should be totally user-friendly and compatible in many languages. The application should be quick to use-no more than 3 pages to navigate through-and accessible without connection.

---

#### Scope

---

This peoject will be made in bubble, a no-code platform, and should be compatible with every mobile device. If this concept is adapted and should be spread around or scaled, then another language would be used to create the application.

The implementation would mainly concern the front-end as it is a UX project. A back-end would still be implemented. However, this one would be smaller than the actual database. As it is a proof of concept, quality would be prioritize as quantity.

---

#### Target Audience

---

**Tourist**: People that aren't from the region, wanting to discover more about the culture and culinary habits of its inhabitants. They would use the application in their own language (or most common one) to discover new wines and cheese quickly during their journey.

**Locals**: People that live annually or partially in the region. They could use the application for recommendation in particular events such as weddings or party.

**Wine Amateurs**: People that likes wines and have knowlegde about them. They could use the application to know more about the different tastes of the wine, with what it suits best.

**Cheese Amateurs**: People that likes cheeses and have knowlegde about them. They could use the application to know more about the different kind of the cheese and their best assortiment.

---

#### Deliverables

---

The main deliverable of this project is the bubble application/source code. Alongside, five documents would be written:

- The Functional Specification
- The Technical Specification
- The Test Plan
- The User Manual
- Management Planning and Weekly Reports

In addition, a 15-minute long presentation would be done in front of the client to show this advancement.

## UI/UX

### Wireframes

---

This project has been into many states and was at first designed as a wireframe on Excalidraw. You can find it by clicking on the following link: [Excalidraw, Read only](https://excalidraw.com/#json=Wq3JrBkpOQ2HtRuHBtujz,ArbCvnuZaU0mUnMAPnNwIg).

**First Idea**:

The first workflow idea was to enter the name of the meal the user would like to eat and a recomendation of wines or cheeses would appear underneath the search input.

![First Workflow Idea](./img/first_workflow_idea.png)

This idea wasn't retained because the database necessary at its well-behavement wasn't feasable for this project.

**Second Idea**:

This one was more based in a menu "a la carte" way. The user could choose between many predefined dishes (local culinary specifities) and it would send them to a description page of the meal with recommendations for wine and cheese.

![Second Workflow Idea](./img/second_workflow_idea.png)

This idea was not retained due to the lack of possible dishes. The user could want something totally different from what is shown in the cards.

**Third Idea**:

This idea was solely based on a tag system. The user could select in the navigation bar (top bar) if he was searching for a wine or a cheese. Afterward, they could select tags to filter results until they find the expected wine/cheese.

![Third Workflow Idea](./img/third_workflow_idea.png)

This idea was rejected for being too specific. Only amateurs of wine and cheese could easily navigate through the different tags to select the desired product.

---

None of those ideas was convenient enough to solve the client's requirement. However, they all have a part that was interesting to dig in. Therefore, a last design was created by merging the three ideas.

**Final Idea**:

![Final Workflow Idea](./img/final_workflow_idea.png)

This idea combines the search bar from the first idea, the cards from the second one, and tags from the last one. However some differences can be spotten.

Firstly, the search bar would be used for wines and cheeses, and not meals anymore. The user would enter the name of a product and they would apear underneath.

Secondly, in the meal description page, the "both section" has been removed, judged as useless with the two others.

Finally, tags won't be visible on the main screen, since there could be a lot of them at the same time. They would be accessible through the "add tags" button and categorized by type and product (wines, cheeses, accompaniement).

### Mockups

---

The Mockups have been made on Figma and can be found in two places, either as a [pdf file]() or with this link: [Figma, Read only](https://www.figma.com/design/YYSa0BxXfyM5PNkdnCFYeZ/BiteMatch-wine-cheese-application?node-id=0-1&t=jhOQGM6NhjMpkwJ6-1).
<!-- TODO: add link to pdf file -->

BiteMatch's Mockups were made following previously mentionned wireframes and through a try & error process.

**First Version**:

This version was made following the last version of the wireframe. Colors used was Intermarché's one, referred as choice 1 in [Color Palette](#color-palette).

![Version One Mockup](./img/version_one_mockup.png)

This version had some changes, mainly on the sizes of different elements, judged as too big, and feeling like an application for elders, which was not the point.

**Second Version**:

This version was modified according to the first version feedback.
