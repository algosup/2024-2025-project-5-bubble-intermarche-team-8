## **Issues Identified**


### 1. **Recommendation Logic – Partial Implementation**
The recommendation engine is now active and generating suggestions based on user input. However, the logic still needs refinement to improve the relevance and diversity of pairings. Additional testing with a broader dataset will help assess its performance at scale.

## **Conclusion**

BITE MATCH has moved beyond the static design stage and now includes core interactivity, functional filters, and a working recommendation system. While major features are implemented, improvements to the recommendation logic, minor UI refinements, and data expansion are the next critical steps. Overall, the application is progressing well toward a more complete version.

## **Next Steps**

- **Refine Recommendation Logic:** Improve the pairing algorithm to ensure more accurate and varied wine and cheese suggestions based on diverse meals.
- **UI Enhancements:** Apply small visual improvements for a more polished user interface.

- **Expand Dataset:** Add more dishes and ingredients to test how the system handles larger and more complex datasets.
