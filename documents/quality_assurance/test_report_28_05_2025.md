## **Objectives**

- Validate the accuracy of wine and cheese recommendations based on selected meals.
- Confirm the proper functioning of filters (e.g., cheese type, wine color, budget).
- Ensure the UI responds appropriately to user input.
- Identify critical usability or logic issues in the recommendation process.

## **Issues Identified**


### 1. **Incomplete Recommendation Logic**
The core recommendation engine is not yet implemented. No actual wine or cheese suggestions are generated based on user input. This remains a top priority for future development phases.

### 2. **Non-Functional Filters**
While the UI elements for filters (e.g., cheese type, wine color) are present, they do not currently affect the results. The filtering logic is still pending implementation.

### 3. **UI Responsiveness Issues**
Some UI components are not fully responsive across devices. Layout inconsistencies and display issues were observed.

### 4. **Design-Only Stage**
At this stage, the app is mainly a static interface. While the UI design is shaping up well, most backend logic and interactive features are still under construction.

## **Conclusion**

BITE MATCH is in its early development stage, with a primary focus on building and refining the user interface. While the visual structure is taking shape, core functionalities such as recommendation logic, filtering, and user interactivity are not yet implemented. Once the backend logic is in place, further testing will be required to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and a seamless user experience.

## **Next Steps**

- Implement the recommendation logic to generate relevant wine and cheese suggestions based on meal selection.
- Develop the filter functionality so users can refine results by wine type, cheese category, or budget.
- Fix layout and responsiveness issues, especially on mobile and tablet devices.
- Connect the front-end UI with the underlying logic once developed.
