# 2024 - 2025 Bubble Intermarché Project - Team 8 | Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to build a multilingual consumer smartphone app for Intermarché’s customers. It will recommend them wine and cheese based on the food they are planning to cook.

The client is the company "Intermarché", a French supermarket chain. Our contact points are Célia and Chrys, rescpectly employee and intern in the company.

## Scope

This project should be done using Bubble, a no-code platform, and be compatible with all types of mobile devices.

This implementation should be only targeting the front-end at first and should offer an interface to customers, simulating the final user experience of the customer on this application.

## Project Plan

Because of the geographical distance between ALGOSUP and the Intermarché located in Sait-Rémy-de-Provence, the kick-off metting has been done remotely, via a video-conference on April 23rd, 2025.

Additionally, for further questions which may arise after project kick-off, it was decided the communication would take place via emails. If needed, shared videoconferences between all the teams and needed stakeholders can be done.

The timeframe of the project being quite short, we will be mainly applying waterfall principles, even though we will use some SCRUM aspects in order to stay as flexible as possible. This will allow us ti iterate over our MVP to reduce the number of potential bugs thorugh user testing and regression testing and meet best the client's expectations.

For user testing, we've been informed we could head to Issoudun's Intermarché to test our product directly in the supermarket and make it test by users.

Through the project, our milestones will be sent to the client in order to have regular feedback.

After the final presentation which will take place on June, 20th 2025, we will do a post-mortem analysis to summarize what happened and make a report to the client and our school director.

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is the source code of the application. In addition, to ensure we stay on the right track, we will submit multiple mock-ups and prototypes to the client via e-mail.

Additional documents will be given to the client:

- Functional Specification
- Technical Specification
- Test Plan
- Management Planning & Weekly reports

In addition, a presentation of our work will be done to the client and our school director as a 15-minute long presentation.
