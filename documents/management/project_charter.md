# 2023 - 2024 Project-5 Flutter Team-8 - Project Charter

## Project definition

This project aims to build a multilingual consumer smartphone app for Intermarché’s customers. It will recommend them wine and cheese based on the food they are planning to cook.

The client is the company "Intermarché", a French supermarket chain. Our contact points are Célia and Chrys, rescpectly employee and intern in the company.

## Scope

This project should be done using Bubble, a no-code platform, and be compatible with all types of mobile devices.

This implementation should be only targeting the front-end at first and should offer an interface to customers, simulating the final user experience of the customer on this application.

## Project Plan

It was decided that additional questions would be made via e-mail and that those communication documents could be uploaded to Github if needed.

This project will be using the waterfall project method due to the limited timeframe. However, we plan to use some aspects of SCRUM management with iterations over an MVP. This incrementation will limit the number of bugs by allowing regression testing.

The planning will be made by defining the tasks and objectives pointed out in the brief and during the meeting. Each of these will be sorted by importance and distributed accordingly. To manage them, we will use a GitHub project in our repository to centralize all the resources. Additional management tools will be used to track the achievements and bottlenecks during the project and keep the client informed during the whole duration of the project.

After the final presentation which will take place on June, 21st 2024, we will do a post-mortem analysis to summarize what happened and make a report to the client.

## Deliverables

The main deliverable is the source code of the application. In addition, to ensure we stay on the right track, we will submit multiple mock-ups and prototypes to the client.

Additional documents will be given to the client:

- Functional Specification
- Technical Specification
- Test Plan
- Management Planning & Weekly reports

In addition, a presentation of our work will be done to the client as a 15-minute long presentation.
