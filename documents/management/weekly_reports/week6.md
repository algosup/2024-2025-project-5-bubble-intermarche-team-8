# Weekly Report â€“ Week 6

**Schedule Status:** ðŸ”µ *Ahead of Schedule (Test Plan)*

## Overview

This week was split into two key phases: finalizing the project documentation during the first half and initiating the development phase in the second half, with the goal of anticipating next week's testing kick-off.

## Accomplishments

1. **Finalized Technical Specifications**
   - The technical specifications were completed and submitted on time, covering all necessary functional and technical details relevant to the project.
2. **Completed Testing Documents and Strategy**
   - The full testing strategy has been defined, and all supporting documents are ready for the upcoming testing phase.
3. **Page Design Nearing Completion**
   - Most application pages have been designed in Bubble, allowing us to shift our focus to logic implementation and initial user testing.

## Challenges

- No significant challenges were encountered this week.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Continue Logic Implementation**
   - We aim to complete the main algorithm implementations by Wednesday, June 4th.
2. **Initiate User Testing**
   - We will begin user testing directly at IntermarchÃ© in Issoudun, enabling us to gather early feedback and validate our design and feature choices.

## Conclusion

This week was marked by strong momentum and meaningful progress. With our documentation finalized and development well underway, we're positioned to begin user testing ahead of schedule. This early feedback loop will allow us to iterate faster and ensure our product is aligned with both user needs and client expectations. We remain confident in our ability to deliver a high-quality and impactful solution.
