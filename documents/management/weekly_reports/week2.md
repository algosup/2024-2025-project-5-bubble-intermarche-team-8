# Weekly Report â€“ Week 2

Schedule Status: ðŸŸ  *Slight Delay on Functional Specifications*

## Overview

This week was dedicated to finalizing the design phase and improving our understanding of the tools we'll use. While we made good progress, we encountered delays related to feature integration in the mockup, which impacted the start of the functional specifications.

## Accomplishments

1. **Mockup Design**
   - We created mockups of the application to visualize the interface and collect client feedback on the overall look and structure.
2. **Exploring Bubble**
   - We spent time getting more familiar with the Bubble platform to improve our efficiency during development and testing.
3. **Communication Setup**
   - We established a clear communication framework between teams and the client. A shared Q\&A database was created to centralize information and avoid repeated questions.
4. **Risk Analysis**
   - Key project risks were identified and assessed. For each risk, we developed mitigation plans to reduce the likelihood of delays or issues.

## Challenges

1. **Starting Functional Specifications**
   - Designing a mockup that cleanly integrates all intended features proved more time-consuming than expected. This slowed the start of our functional specification work.

## Plans for Next Week

1. **Advance Functional Specifications**
   - Continue building out the functional specifications with more detail and clarity, particularly for critical features that are still not fully defined.
2. **Begin Technical Specifications**
   - Identify and document the core technical components of the application. A first draft of the technical specifications will be produced.
3. **Submit Mockups**
   - Present the current mockups to the client and gather their feedback to ensure alignment before moving forward.

## Conclusion

Although this week introduced a slight delay, it marked a key milestone in the project's progress. We now have a clear visual foundation through our mockups and have taken important steps to streamline communication and reduce future risks. We are committed to focusing our efforts next week to get back on schedule, as outlined in the Gantt chart.
