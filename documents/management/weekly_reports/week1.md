# Weekly Report â€“ Week 1

Schedule Status: ðŸŸ¢ *On Time*

## Overview

This week focused on kicking off the project and building a clear understanding of its scope. Most of our time was spent aligning expectations, testing early ideas, and planning the weeks ahead.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - We received an initial brief from the client, who remains open to suggestions and new features. We held a meeting to clarify a few uncertainties and align on the project's direction.
2. **Early Prototyping**
   - We created initial wireframes to explore possible layouts and features for the app. While no version has been finalized yet, this helped us identify what we expect from the future interface.
3. **Project Planning**
   - Key milestones were defined and structured into a Gantt chart to guide our work. This planning tool will help us monitor progress and ensure we stay on schedule.

## Challenges

1. **New Team Organization**
   - As a newly formed team, we needed time to define roles and responsibilities and establish how we will work together.
2. **Learning Bubble**
   - Getting started with Bubble, a no-code platform, has been challenging since it's new to all of us. Weâ€™re currently building our skills and getting more comfortable with the tool.
3. **Team Restructuring**
   - We learned that Guillaume, our original project manager, wonâ€™t be able to continue with the project. We had to reorganize tasks and redistribute responsibilities to adapt quickly.

## Plans for Next Week

1. **Start Functional Specifications**
   - Begin outlining the functional specifications and define the app's core features based on the chosen prototype.
2. **Design Mockups**
   - Create high-fidelity mockups that reflect the final design of the app, which will be shared with users and the client for feedback and validation.
3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to maintain progress and avoid delays.

## Conclusion

The first week has laid a solid foundation for the project. We clarified expectations, started shaping the app, and set up a clear project timeline. Despite a few early challengesâ€”including learning a new tool and reorganizing the teamâ€”we adapted quickly and maintained a positive dynamic. With the functional and design phases starting next week, weâ€™re well-positioned to keep up momentum and move the project forward confidently.
