# Weekly Report â€“ Week 5

**Schedule Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Track*

## Overview

This week was dedicated to advancing our technical documentation, particularly the technical specifications and test plan. These documents will form the foundation for the upcoming development and testing phases of the project.

## Accomplishments

1. **Technical Specifications Progress**
   - We completed the majority of the technical specifications. Special attention was given to structure and clarity to ensure the document is both comprehensive and easy to follow.
2. **Drafted the Test Plan**
   - A first version of our test plan has been written. It includes the core testing strategy and key test cases derived from our analysis of the applicationâ€™s main features and expected user flows.
3. **Ongoing App Design in Bubble**
   - We continued designing the interface in Bubble. The structure is now almost ready for us to begin implementing the application logic next week.

## Challenges

1. **Maintaining Consistency in Technical Specifications**
   - It was challenging to maintain consistency and avoid redundancy while ensuring all important aspects were clearly documented.
2. **Aligning on Testing Scope**
   - There were differing views on what should be tested. After a team-wide discussion, we reached a shared understanding and finalized the scope of the initial test plan.

## Plans for Next Week

1. **Complete Technical Specifications**
   - Finalize the remaining sections of the technical documentation, especially those related to application logic, so development can proceed smoothly.
2. **Finalize the Test Plan**
   - Complete the test plan to ensure we are ready to test all core functionalities once development begins.
3. **Begin Implementing Logic in Bubble**
   - With documentation in place, we will start implementing workflows and logic within Bubble to bring the application to life.

## Conclusion

This week marked a major shift from planning to execution. With technical specifications nearly finalized and a test plan underway, weâ€™re setting the stage for focused development and iterative user testing. The team is motivated and aligned, and weâ€™re confident that this strong foundation will lead to a smooth and efficient development phase. We're getting closer to delivering a user-ready solution that meets both client expectations and market needs.
