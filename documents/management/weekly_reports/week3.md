# Weekly Report â€“ Week 3

**Schedule Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Time*

## Overview

This week focused on product research and laying the foundation for development. We made significant progress in selecting our products, refining the user experience, and beginning both interface development and technical documentation.

## Accomplishments

1. **Product Selection**
   - We finalized the list of wines and cheeses that will be featured in the proof of concept, including all necessary information (tags, descriptions, references).
2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - After exchanging emails with the client, we identified and addressed usability issuesâ€”particularly for tourists and non-experts. This led to adjustments in the user journey to make the app more intuitive.
3. **Interface Development in Bubble**
   - We began implementing the appâ€™s visual layout in Bubble. This early development will help us prepare for real-world testing with IntermarchÃ© customers in four weeks.
4. **Technical Specifications Draft**
   - Work on the technical specifications has begun, and weâ€™ve started discussing Bubbleâ€™s implementation limits with the client.

## Challenges

1. **Cross-Team Communication**
   - One of the teams we coordinate sent a similar email to the client after ours. This overlap caused some confusion and could affect team's communication dynamics. We will reinforce communication protocols to avoid this in the future.
2. **Bubble Plan Limitations**
   - The free version of Bubble has imposed some technical constraints. Weâ€™re actively adapting our development strategy to work within these limitations.

## Plans for Next Week

1. **Finalize Functional Specifications**
   - We aim to complete the functional specifications by Friday, incorporating client feedback on the mockups.
2. **Refine Technical Specifications**
   - Continue researching and consulting with our instructor Julien to ensure our technical solutions are appropriate and optimized for the projectâ€™s needs.
3. **Meeting with IntermarchÃ© Aisle Chiefs**
   - Weâ€™ve scheduled a meeting with aisle managers at IntermarchÃ© to fine-tune the appâ€™s recommendation algorithm.

## Conclusion

This week marked a turning point, as we moved from preparation to active development. With the product list finalized and user journey refined, we now have a clear direction for building a relevant, accessible app. Our early progress in Bubble and ongoing documentation efforts put us in a strong position to meet upcoming milestones. Despite minor coordination issues and platform constraints, our team remains fully aligned and motivated. Weâ€™re confident in our ability to stay on track and deliver a high-quality proof of concept that meets both user needs and client expectations.
