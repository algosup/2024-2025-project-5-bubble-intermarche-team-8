# Weekly Report â€“ Week 7

**Schedule Status:** ðŸŸ¢ _On Track_

## Overview

Due to limited time available for the project this week, progress was modest. Our focus was primarily on refining the application and initiating the first round of user testing.

## Accomplishments

1. **Started User Testing**
   - We began testing the application with friends and family in sample IntermarchÃ© stores. While this allowed us to observe initial reactions and guidance needs, the tests were inconclusive due to recurring bugs in the app.
2. **Refined Application**
   - We reviewed the existing components of the application, identifying and fixing inconsistencies that had previously gone unnoticed. This also helped us realign the app with the design and naming conventions defined at the start of the project.

## Challenges

1. **Testing on a Diverse User Panel**
   - Our current testing has been limited to French- and English-speaking users. As a result, we still lack feedback from users with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, which is essential for validating the app's international usability.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finish Development of the Application**

- All core features should be implemented and reviewed. The application must meet the specifications and expectations shared by the client during our previous meetings.

2. **Test on a More Diverse User Panel**

- We plan to conduct testing with a broader range of users from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds to evaluate the appâ€™s accessibility and inclusivity.

## Conclusion

While we made some progress this week, it fell short of our expectations, but we stay on time. Next week will require a concentrated effort on both development and testing to ensure we deliver a complete, stable, and user-friendly product. By reinforcing our focus and expanding our test panel, we aim to meet our quality standards and client expectations in the final stages of the project.
