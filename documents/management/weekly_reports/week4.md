# Weekly Report â€“ Week 4

**Schedule Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Track*

## Overview

This week was focused on consolidating the project foundations. We finalized key documentation, held an in-depth meeting with the client, and made significant progress in our understanding of the Bubble environment.

## Accomplishments

1. **Client Meeting**

   * We had an extended exchange with the client to clarify their feedback and expectations. Their positive response confirmed we are aligned with their vision and on the right track.
2. **Functional Specifications Finalized**

   * We completed the functional specifications, clearly outlining all user-facing features and functionalities of the application, with technical implementation details left for the upcoming technical specifications.
3. **Improved Technical Understanding of Bubble**

   * With Julien's support, we made strong progress in mastering Bubbleâ€™s capabilities and limitations, which will help us finalize the technical specifications.

## Challenges

1. **Client Communication Confusion**

   * As mentioned last week, an earlier email created confusion when the client assumed all mockups had been submitted, though only Team 5â€™s had. This misunderstanding affected multiple teams and required time to resolve.
2. **Dip in Motivation**

   * The focus on research and repetitive documentation tasks led to a slight decrease in team motivation. We plan to address this through individual interviews next week to better support each team member.

## Plans for Next Week

1. **Individual Team Member Interviews**

   * Scheduled for Monday morning, these one-on-one interviews aim to check in on individual challenges, concerns, and motivation, as we approach the halfway point of the project.
2. **Refine Technical Specifications & Test Plan**

   * Our goal is to finalize both documents to ensure our developers can work efficiently without ambiguity.
3. **Continue Interface Development**

   * With mockups validated, we will now accelerate the implementation of user interfaces in Bubble before tackling technical integration.

## Conclusion

This week marked a key turning point in the project. With finalized functional specifications and clearer alignment with the client, weâ€™ve moved out of the planning phase and into execution. Julienâ€™s guidance has accelerated our technical understanding of Bubble, giving us the confidence to push forward. While minor setbacks in communication and motivation surfaced, we are actively addressing them. The team is committed to moving ahead with clarity, unity, and renewed energy to deliver a polished and impactful product.
