## Weekly Report - Week 1

Schedule Status: ðŸŸ¢ *On Time*

### Overview

This week focused on kicking off the project and building a clear understanding of its scope. Most of our time was spent aligning expectations, testing early ideas, and planning the weeks ahead.

### Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - We received an initial brief from the client, who remains open to suggestions and new features. We held a meeting to clarify a few uncertainties and align on the project's direction.

   - We created initial wireframes to explore possible layouts and features for the app. While no version has been finalized yet, this helped us identify what we expect from the future interface.
3. **Project Planning**
   - Key milestones were defined and structured into a Gantt chart to guide our work. This planning tool will help us monitor progress and ensure we stay on schedule.

### Challenges

1. **New Team Organization**
   - As a newly formed team, we needed time to define roles and responsibilities and establish how we will work together.
2. **Learning Bubble**
   - Getting started with Bubble, a no-code platform, has been challenging since it's new to all of us. Weâ€™re currently building our skills and getting more comfortable with the tool.
3. **Team Restructuring**
   - We learned that Guillaume, our original project manager, wonâ€™t be able to continue with the project. We had to reorganize tasks and redistribute responsibilities to adapt quickly.

### Plans for Next Week

1. **Start Functional Specifications**
   - Begin outlining the functional specifications and define the app's core features based on the chosen prototype.
2. **Design Mockups**
   - Create high-fidelity mockups that reflect the final design of the app, which will be shared with users and the client for feedback and validation.
3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to maintain progress and avoid delays.

### Conclusion

The first week has laid a solid foundation for the project. We clarified expectations, started shaping the app, and set up a clear project timeline. Despite a few early challengesâ€”including learning a new tool and reorganizing the teamâ€”we adapted quickly and maintained a positive dynamic. With the functional and design phases starting next week, weâ€™re well-positioned to keep up momentum and move the project forward confidently.

## Weekly Report - Week 2


Schedule Status: ðŸŸ  *Slight Delay on Functional Specifications*

### Overview

This week was dedicated to finalizing the design phase and improving our understanding of the tools we'll use. While we made good progress, we encountered delays related to feature integration in the mockup, which impacted the start of the functional specifications.

### Accomplishments

1. **Mockup Design**
   - We created mockups of the application to visualize the interface and collect client feedback on the overall look and structure.
2. **Exploring Bubble**
   - We spent time getting more familiar with the Bubble platform to improve our efficiency during development and testing.
3. **Communication Setup**
   - We established a clear communication framework between teams and the client. A shared Q\&A database was created to centralize information and avoid repeated questions.
4. **Risk Analysis**
   - Key project risks were identified and assessed. For each risk, we developed mitigation plans to reduce the likelihood of delays or issues.

### Challenges

1. **Starting Functional Specifications**
   - Designing a mockup that cleanly integrates all intended features proved more time-consuming than expected. This slowed the start of our functional specification work.

### Plans for Next Week

1. **Advance Functional Specifications**
   - Continue building out the functional specifications with more detail and clarity, particularly for critical features that are still not fully defined.
2. **Begin Technical Specifications**
   - Identify and document the core technical components of the application. A first draft of the technical specifications will be produced.
3. **Submit Mockups**
   - Present the current mockups to the client and gather their feedback to ensure alignment before moving forward.

### Conclusion

Although this week introduced a slight delay, it marked a key milestone in the project's progress. We now have a clear visual foundation through our mockups and have taken important steps to streamline communication and reduce future risks. We are committed to focusing our efforts next week to get back on schedule, as outlined in the Gantt chart.

## Weekly Report â€“ Week 3

**Schedule Status:** ðŸŸ¢ *On Time*

### Overview

This week focused on product research and laying the foundation for development. We made significant progress in selecting our products, refining the user experience, and beginning both interface development and technical documentation.

### Accomplishments

1. **Product Selection**
   - We finalized the list of wines and cheeses that will be featured in the proof of concept, including all necessary information (tags, descriptions, references).
2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - After exchanging emails with the client, we identified and addressed usability issuesâ€”particularly for tourists and non-experts. This led to adjustments in the user journey to make the app more intuitive.
3. **Interface Development in Bubble**
   - We began implementing the appâ€™s visual layout in Bubble. This early development will help us prepare for real-world testing with IntermarchÃ© customers in four weeks.
4. **Technical Specifications Draft**
   - Work on the technical specifications has begun, and weâ€™ve started discussing Bubbleâ€™s implementation limits with the client.

### Challenges

1. **Cross-Team Communication**
   - One of the teams we coordinate sent a similar email to the client after ours. This overlap caused some confusion and could affect team's communication dynamics. We will reinforce communication protocols to avoid this in the future.
2. **Bubble Plan Limitations**
   - The free version of Bubble has imposed some technical constraints. Weâ€™re actively adapting our development strategy to work within these limitations.

### Plans for Next Week

1. **Finalize Functional Specifications**
   - We aim to complete the functional specifications by Friday, incorporating client feedback on the mockups.
2. **Refine Technical Specifications**
   - Continue researching and consulting with our instructor Julien to ensure our technical solutions are appropriate and optimized for the projectâ€™s needs.
